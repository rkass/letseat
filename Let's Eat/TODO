Current Issues:

1) I couldn't see casey in my contacts; I added another copy of his contact as a separate entry and it read that.

It reads Casey Cannon, but not Casey even though those numbers are the same.

2) Sometimes after swiping a notification the view layout is out of whack, and the user is forced to restart the app.

3) Sometimes after selecting an invitee they are inadvertantly unchecked.

4) Sometimes notifications don't show

5) Crashes after not showing contacts (resolved)

6) Handle nothing open more gracefully
